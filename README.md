## To-Do

-  add sampling functionality as an option to not try to deal with all data from the huge sources
- make protocol for what fields to query to get locations if they don't have the coordinates?
    ie get institution ID, else get institution name and country, else get author name and country and year?
- Genderize API to get gender stats from list of authors
- swap print statements for progress bar
