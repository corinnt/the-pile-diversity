0,Ann Freeman; Paul Meyvaert; ,The Meaning of Theodulf's Apse Mosaic at Germigny-des-Prés,2001,"To an extent hitherto unrecognized, the work Theodulf composed in Charlemagne's name (often called the Libri Carolini but actually entitled Opus Caroli regis contra synodum) provides a key to the symbolic meaning of the mosaic he placed in the apse of the small church he erected for his personal use at his country villa in Germigny-des-Pres. Religio-political circumstances prevented Charlemagne from circulating the manifesto, but its arguments and its contents remained fresh in Theodulf's mind, especially when he visited churches in Rome during the several months he spent there, in 800-801, on the occasion of Charlemagne's coronation as emperor by Pope Leo III. Some of Rome's mosaics, particularly those at S. Maria Maggiore and SS. Cosma e Damiano, recalled crucial chapters he had composed for the Opus Caroli and provided him with the basic theme for the Germigny mosaic. In highly symbolic terms, which can only be deciphered in the light of the Opus Caroli, the mosaic spells out God's plan for the salvati..."
1,Joyce Kubiski; ,"Orientalizing Costume in Early Fifteenth-Century French Manuscript Painting (Cité des Dames Master, Limbourg Brothers, Boucicaut Master, and Bedford Master)",2001,"A group of miniaturists working in or near Paris between 1400 and 1415 significantly expanded the existing pictorial repertoire of orientalizing costume. They depicted elements of the eastern fashions worn by peoples with whom the French aristocracy had had recent contact--in battle and through diplomatic embassies--including Central Asian tribes that had settled in Hungary, the predominantly Turkish armies of Islam, and members of the Byzantine court. While the miniaturists often mix together garments from a variety of different cultures into an eclectic costume, the individual elements of the clothing are authentic representations of foreign dress. This approach, which paradoxically allowed individual features of dress to be identified while, at the same time, obscuring cultural origins in an exotic, fantastical mix, merges easterners into an indistinct, entirely foreign other."
2,Kirstin Noreen; ,"Lay Patronage and the Creation of Papal Sanctity during the Gregorian Reform: The Case of Sant'Urbano alla Caffarella, Rome",2001,"This article examines representations of papal sanctity in the late eleventh-century wall paintings of Sant'Urbano alla Caffarella. An analysis of these frescoes, which include the earliest known example of the life of Urban I (d. 230), reaffirms that the ecclesiastical environment of the Gregorian Reform influenced the development of new hagiographic imagery. Cults of Early Christian papal martyrs, such as Urban I, were promoted to support the authority of contemporary popes like Urban II (1088-1099). The frescoes in Sant'Urbano, however, were not the product of papal or ecclesiastical patronage; instead, the images were sponsored by two lay donors, who are pictured in the Crucifixion scene. This pictorial program offers an important index of the extent to which reform ideology permeated various levels of society: artistic commissions came not only from high-level ecclesiastics but also from lay members of the community. The wall paintings in Sant'Urbano demonstrate that any concept of an artistic ""platform"" at the time of the Gregorian Reform must be broadened to include lay commissions. These frescoes, in which private and public themes converge, illustrate that even seemingly peripheral imagery was informed by the ideals espoused by the ecclesiastical reformers."
3,Adam F. Cohen; Anne Derbes; ,Bernward and Eve at Hildesheim,2001,"The bronze doors of Hildesheim (ca. 1007-1015), commissioned by Bishop Bernward, are famous for their sophisticated typological program, which conveys a message about the Fall of humanity and the opposition of Eve and Mary. Divergences from the door's pictorial models indicate that the program at Hildesheim innovatively represents Eve as a sexually provocative woman. Although grounded in patristic theology, Bernward's presentation reflects contemporary clerical concerns. At the time the doors were executed, the bishop was locked in a struggle with Sophia, abbess of Gandersheim. Bernward's biographers describe her as malevolent and dissolute; the doors themselves constitute a subtle polemical argument against the dangers posed by seductive and insolent women."
4,Marvin Trachtenberg; ,"Suger's Miracles, Branner's Bourges: Reflections on ""Gothic Architecture"" as Medieval Modernism",2000,"When it becomes clear that a given interpretative model (or set of criteria) contains irreducible contradictions and is incapable of resolving certain stubborn problems, it is time for a new paradigm. Recognizing that scholarship on Gothic architecture has long since reached this impasse, this study identifies new terms of understanding in the oppositional pair ""modernism"" and ""historicism."" These two transhistorical concepts are found to offer numerous interpretative advantages over such traditional categories as ""skeletal form,"" ""diaphaneity,"" ""linearity,"" ""diagonality,"" ""square schematism,"" and the like, all of which are severely burdened by the well known constrictive problematics of ""style,"" among other difficulties. Properly defined and understood, the modernism/historicism paradigm is shown to offer numerous advantages in studying medieval architecture across a wide range of concerns, from descriptive, componential, and formal analysis to social, intellectual, and contextual integration. The entire apparatus of the great cathedrals is seen in a radically new, comprehensive way, and such intractable historical problems as that of the seemingly oxymoronic ""Gothic column"" are resolved. The proposed paradigm is further explored and tested regarding both word and image in medieval architecture, in a new reading of the controversial texts of Abbot Suger on Saint-Denis, and in a revised solution to the Bourges ""problem."""
5,Ilene H. Forsyth; ,Narrative at Moissac: Schapiro's Legacy,2002,"The narrative cycles at the south portal of Moissac's famous Romanesque abbey-displaying the parable of the poor leper Lazarus and the story of the Infancy of Christ-are studied here in relation to the thinking of Meyer Schapiro. His early publications as well as his later oral comments on the narratives are considered, along with his views on the principles of expressive form that help to explain the dynamics of Romanesque sculpture. Schapiro's ideas are then extended into new areas of interpretation. It is argued that the program of the portal turns on more than simple antithesis: changeling chiasmic schemes lead to open-ended visual play and, within the porch's thematic design, a complex counterpoint of learned, iconographic permutations issues from an emphasis on miserliness and generosity, resulting in a visual discourse that encourages charitable philanthropy from the feudal nobility in accord with the needs of the abbey. The sculptures' sensuality and sexuality, it is claimed, are informed by a special monastic character that intertwines the realms of sacred and secular thought. In an epilogue, arguments are presented for dating the portal sculptures to the abbacy of Ansquetil, specifically ca. 1100-15."
6,Michael Davis; Linda Neagley; ,"Mechanics and Meaning: Plan Design at Saint-Urbain, Troyes and Saint-Ouen, Rouen",2000,"This article presents case studies of the designs of Saint-Urbain, Troyes and Saint-Ouen, Rouen. Based on exacting surveys of the two churches, our research reveals the strategies by which Gothic master masons gave order and purpose to the building process. In proposing the operations used to lay out the plans on site, we find that Saint-Urbain and Saint-Ouen were generated using the same geometric procedures that were employed for other northern French edifices, for example, Amiens Cathedral and Saint-Maclou, Rouen, and those discussed in later German design booklets: progressive squaring, root 2 relationships, and golden section proportions. This remarkable consistency of method suggests that basic rules of plan and elevation design existed, that they were passed orally from master to apprentice, and that diversity was achieved by slight inflections and varied combinations of these operations dictated by the specific factors of site, size, and function. In addition to demonstrating the impressive economy and flexibility of Gothic design techniques, our analyses of the plans, reinforced by documentary evidence, reveals that symbolic considerations were integral to the processes of layout and construction. At both Saint-Urbain and Saint-Ouen, a significant number, encoded into the center of the plan at an initial stage of design, invested the building with meaning as the geometry unfolded. Thus, rather than being simply a skilled craft performance, Gothic ecclesiastical architecture arose from a calculated intercourse of practical planning and symbolic thought to produce material visions of the transcendental ""tabernacles of the Lord."""
7,Michael Gaudio; ,Matthew Paris and the Cartography of the Margins,2000,"During the mid-thirteenth century, Matthew Paris produced visual itineraries depicting the route from London to the Holy Land. These maps belong to an exegetical cartographic mode also found in other medieval maps, such as mappaemundi. Rather than serving as practical tools for directing pilgrims to the Holy Land, Matthew's itineraries served as occasions for spiritual pilgrimages carried out within the confines of St. Albans monastery. In contrast to the cartography that emerged during the early modern period, in which nature is conceived as positive and spatially continuous, these exegetical maps treat nature negatively as a space of discontinuity between sites of civilization. Through various cartographic strategies, nature is invoked only to be confined to the margins of medieval pilgrimage. Emptied of meaning, the natural world thus becomes a non-space that allows human interpretation to enter into the cartographic text."
8,Karen O. Mathews; ,Reading Romanesque Sculpture: The Iconography and Reception of the South Portal Sculpture at Santiago de Compostela,2000,"Although recent scholarship and reception theory have demonstrated the importance of audience in the actualization of meaning in images and texts, more concerted attention is necessary to understand the polyvalent iconographic readings of Romanesque sculpture. Imagery on the south portal of the cathedral of Santiago conveyed messages of ecclesiastical authority to specific audiences, namely the cathedral chapter and inhabitants of the town. The unseverable link between the cathedral of Santiago and pilgrimage, however, has caused scholars to overlook the importance of the local population as an audience for the cult of St. James and the art patronage program of the cathedral's bishop, Diego Gelmírez (1100-1140). This paper will explore the reception of the iconography of the cathedral's south portal by various audiences in the twelfth century. The cathedral canons and townspeople may have responded to the imagery in a manner diametrically opposed to the prescribed reading of this sculptural ensemble commissioned by the bishop. The audiences' multiple readings, mis-readings, and non-readings of the south portal imagery demonstrate the indeterminacy inherent in the iconography of Romanesque sculpture and highlight the importance of the dialectical relationship between production and reception to its understanding."
9,Richard K. Emmerson; ,"The Representation of Antichrist in Hildegard of Bingen's Scivias: Image, Word, Commentary, and Visionary Experience",2002,"Drawing on inherited traditional symbolism, apocalyptic iconography, and monastic exegesis, this essay explores how the representation of the Vision of the Last Days in Hildegards Scivias, and, in particular, the image of Antichrist, may have been understood by Hildegard, her monastic magister, Volmar, and other members of her earliest audience. Focusing on the miniature included in the lost Rupertsberg manuscript of Scivias as the best witness to Hildegards original designs, the essay argues that the vision, its visual rendering, Hildegards description of it, and the commentary on it spoken by the Voice from Heaven are qualitatively and temporally distinct aspects of Hildegards visionary experience. In a concluding analysis, the frontispiece of the Rupertsberg manuscript, which depicts Hildegard in vision, is shown to distinguish four stages in her visionary experience."
10,Stephen Perkinson; ,"Engin and Artifice: Describing Creative Agency at the Court of France, ca. 1400",2002,"This article examines descriptions of artistic activities found in late medieval French literary works, comparing these textual descriptions with visual evidence to recover a vocabulary of creative agency. Authors, reacting to the creative activities they witnessed around them, refashioned terminology found in earlier literary accounts of image-making and developed a set of terms to describe and define the creative process. They focused on one quality in particular as crucial to the artist: engin. To say that an image-maker had a remarkable engin implied that he or she possessed tremendous powers of memory and imagination--abilities more highly valued than even the most developed manual skill, or artifice. Owing to their ability to produce sacred images from memory, exceptional image-makers were believed to possess a virtuous, almost saintly, character. By establishing these concepts in the minds of their courtly readers, late medieval French authors created conditions in which ambitious image-makers could showcase their particular skills and abilities."
11,Carola Jäggi; ,Eastern Choir or Western Gallery? The Problem of the Place of the Nuns' Choir in Königsfelden and Other Early Mendicant Nunneries,2001,"A rich corpus of written documentation exists to aid in the reconstruction of conventual life in the Franciscan double monastery of Konigsfelden, founded in 1308 by Elisabeth, widow of king Albrecht of Habsburg. This documentation includes directives concerning the rights and responsibilities of the male and female communities and the organization of the Divine Office that were issued by Agnes, Elisabeth's daughter, who supervised the monastery for 48 years after Elisabeth's death in 1313. In addition, excavations of the 1980s have provided important information about the building history of the church, which still survives, and of other structures formerly in the monastic enclosure. Despite this wealth of material, however, it remains unclear precisely how the male and female communities shared the monastic space. A salient question is the position of the nuns' choir. Archeologists have determined that in the fourteenth century a narrow wooden gallery existed to the west of the nave, accessible from the ..."
12,Jeanne-Marie Musto; ,John Scottus Eriugena and the Upper Cover of the Lindau Gospels,2001,"The unusual Crucifixion scene on the upper cover of the Lindau Gospels, produced during the reign of Charles the Bald (840-877), has long defied full explanation. Among contemporary works, a miniature in the Coronation Sacramentary offers particularly suggestive parallels in form and structure and aids in the analysis of the Lindau cover's reinterpretation of early Carolingian crucifixion imagery--especially as represented by a lost but well-documented ivory panel formerly in Berlin. Other aspects of the Lindau Crucifixion are unprecedented. These include the arrangement of the eight figures who seem to hover weightless as they approach Christ and the placement of the personified Sol and Luna who, as Albert M. Friend, Jr. first observed in 1923, together represent an eclipse of the sun. In explanation of this motif, Friend turned to the writings of the Neoplatonist theologian Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, translated by Charles the Bald's court philosopher, John Scottus Eriugena; Johannes Reil subsequently drew upon Eriugena's poetry. But the most compelling connections between the Lindau Crucifixion and Eriugena's writings, it is here argued, are found in his magisterial Periphyseon, with its powerful metaphors for the return of creation to Christ. The Periphyseon provides compelling evidence that what motivated the otherwise mysterious iconography of the upper cover of the Lindau Gospels was Eriugena's singular eschatology."
13,Christina Maranci; ,Byzantium through Armenian Eyes: Cultural Appropriation and the Church of Zuart'noc',2001,"The seventh-century church of Zuart'noc' in Armenia is the earliest and largest aisled tetraconch in the medieval Caucasus. While previous scholarship has described the monument as a product of Byzantine influence, here Zuart'noc' is examined from the point of view of the patron, Nersēs III (640-661). This article argues that the construction was intended to convey a specific political message: to demonstrate the patron's alliance with the Byzantine political and cultural world. Through choices made in the iconography of the sculptural program, in epigraphic language and devices, in architectural planning, and perhaps even in the selection of the dedication, the church presents a network of references to the Byzantine imperium. As such, it is revealing of Armenian perceptions of Byzantium, standing as a witness to seventh-century diplomatic ties in a time of acute military tension on the eastern frontier."
14,Achim Timmermann; ,The Avenging Crucifix: Some Observations on the Iconography of the Living Cross,2001,"The so-called Living Cross is one of the most striking eucharistic allegories of the later Middle Ages. About three dozen examples survive, most of them wall paintings. This essay seeks to place the development of the image in its visual, historical, and cultural framework. When related to a particular kind of allegory of Justice known in Tuscany and the Veneto in the late Trecento and early Quattrocento, the Living Cross reads as a polemical gloss on two contemporary and very powerful narratives of Eucharist abuse. These narratives identify Jews and heretics (especially the Hussites) as the principal foes of the Corpus Christi and, by extension, of the Roman Church itself. Reversing the roles of object and subject, of victim and executioner, the Living Cross transforms the Eucharist's archetypal enemies into impotent targets of divinely authorized violence, and the weapons it employs become emblems of eschatological justice."
15,Leila Cuttle; ,The Boucicaut Masters,2002,"This paper examines the strategies and achievements of independent illuminators in early fifteenth-century Paris through consideration of manuscripts associated with the ""Boucicaut Master."" The prodigious output of Boucicaut manuscripts, many of them Books of Hours, was accomplished by a group of loosely affiliated illuminators trained to work in a common style. Indeed the coordination of the production of large numbers of manuscripts in a consistent style can be considered one of the greatest achievements of the Boucicaut illuminators. Having no sustained connections with particular court patrons, the artists successfully adapted their work to the demands and resources of a broad and diverse clientele. These very conditions, it is here argued, fostered the artistic innovations for which the Boucicaut manuscripts are famous."
16,Melissa D. Katz; ,Architectural Polychromy and the Painters' Trade in Medieval Spain,2002,"Bridging the crafts of panel painting, wall painting, sculpture, and architecture, architectural polychromy once provided steady employment for medieval painters. Teams of workers were required to decorate vast expanses of carved façades, sculpted portals, and vaulted interiors. Little exterior polychromy has survived, owing to factors as diverse as changing tastes, religious disapprobation, and exposure to the elements. This loss distorts our impression of medieval architectural sculpture and prevents us from grasping the integral relationship between sculpted form and colored surface in medieval art. In addition, the heterogeneous character of medieval painters' tasks is obscured. This paper explores the role of medieval painters in the decoration of architectural sculpture and other carved images. The polychromed portal of the Collegiate Church of Toro, painted somewhere between 1284 and 1295, serves as the starting point for an investigation into artistic practices and workshop organization in central Spain in the thirteenth century and later. Contemporary guild regulations, inventories, chancery records, and manuscript illumination also provide evidence concerning the late medieval painters' trade."
17,Bernd Nicolai; ,Orders in Stone: Social Reality and Artistic Approach. The Case of the Strasbourg South Portal,2002,"The portal of the south transept of Strasbourg cathedral provides the focus for a study of the assimilation and transformation of the pre-Rayonnant Gothic portal in the northern Holy Roman Empire. Strategies employed in portal's iconographic program-studied in conjunction with the sculptures of the contemporary Angels' Pillar in the south transept-are investigated in relation to function, audience, and local historical circumstances. Specifically the program is shown to combine eschatological and mariological elements, drawing on theological currents of the time, so as to emphasize ecclesiastical authority. It is demonstrated that the statue of Solomon in conjunction with triumphant Ecclesia and fallen Synagoga provided an appropriate stage for the ecclesiastical court that was held in front of the portal, especially in an era when heresy was aggressively combatted. Moreover the motif of the ultimate reconciliation of Ecclesia and Synagoga was fitting in the reign of the rex pacificus, Emperor Frederick II. The portal, it is here argued, might date as late as ca. 1235."
18,C. Edson Armi; ,The Corbel Table,2000,"The corbel table is the most characteristic feature of early Romanesque architecture in southern Europe. This article considers the corbel table as more than a separate decorative device, in the context of Lombard structure, construction, and design. The corbel table served a structural function similar to that of a relieving arch over doors and windows, and masons used it to stabilize vaults and walls. Later in the eleventh century, Burgundian masons refined the structure of the corbel table, and merged it with ashlar supports, to create the fully vaulted three-story elevation of Cluny III."
19,Georgia Sommers Wright; ,The Reinvention of the Portrait Likeness in the Fourteenth Century,2000,"This essay will make the case that the reinvented likeness, dependent upon the patron, does not develop in a predictable fashion but appears and disappears. It is frequently produced in a milieu in which artists are also creating individualized or naturalistic heads, and this simultaneity has led scholars to assume that the latter are also likenesses, produced by artists without commissions. While these latter heads are lively, the documented likenesses are often disappointing. Why did not these Berninis before their time do a better job with the patron? Medieval artists were not trained to work from nature: rendering a three-dimensional head after a unique model is perhaps the most difficult task that a sculptor or even a painter could undertake. I will apply three criteria for the identification of early, that is fourteenth-century, likenesses: they must be securely identified, they must have been produced during the lifetime of the patron, and there must be two or more that resemble one another. I will discuss four patrons, Boniface VIII, Rudolf IV of Austria, and two of his relatives, Emperor Karl IV and Charles V of France; these are the only cases that satisfy my criteria."
20,Véronique P. Day; ,"Portrait of a Provincial Artist: Jehan Gillemer, Poitevin Illuminator",2002,"The trial record of Jehan Gillemer, accused of espionage in 1472, provides rare insight into the world of a provincial illuminator in France in the late Middle Ages. Gillemer's detailed responses to his interrogators provide a picture of the professional routine of an artisan active in the Poitou, including his maintenance of a sizable workshop, his earnest efforts to promote a professional reputation, his constant search for new patrons, and the incessant traveling that these tasks required. The document also offers a remarkable characterization of Gillemer as an industrious, God-fearing, and superstitious man."
21,David Buckton; John Osborne; ,The Enamel of Doge Ordelaffo Falier on the Pala d'Oro in Venice,2000,"A detailed technical examination of the figure of Doge Ordelaffo Falier on the Pala d'Oro in the church of San Marco at Venice reveals that the figure and identifying inscription are both original, with the exception of the head and halo. The intention from the outset was therefore to depict the doge of Venice, and not, as has generally been assumed, an emperor of Byzantium. It is suggested that the head was altered for the sole purpose of adding the halo, signifier of imperial dignity, and that this change was made during the 1209 restoration of the Pala, as part of Venice's efforts to reinvent its history in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade."
22,William A. V. Clark; ,"Reading Reims, I. The Sculptures on the Chapel Buttresses",2000,"Notre-Dame at Reims is one of the most famous and influential of all medieval cathedrals, but it does not express an unchanging, monolithic system of beliefs through its decoration, as it has so often been presented. Although it is best known as the coronation church of the kings of France, we need to keep in mind that over the course of 800 years there have been only 25 coronations in the cathedral and that its meanings are far richer and more complex than those that attend the site of coronation. By focusing on the earliest of its many programs of decoration, namely, the twelve figures at the top of the radiating chapel wall and pier buttresses, and by using detailed photographs made prior to the 1914 bombardments, this study demonstrates that from the beginning Reims was constructed with many overlapping, multivalent meanings that were understood and interpreted in different ways over time."
23,M. Cecilia Gaposchkin; ,The King of France and the Queen of Heaven: The Iconography of the Porte Rouge of Notre-Dame of Paris,2000,"The Porte Rouge (ca. 1270) on the north flank of Notre-Dame in Paris depicts a king and queen kneeling before an image of the Coronation of the Virgin. These figures have traditionally been identified as donor portraits of Louis IX and his wife Marguerite of Provence. The royal pair never were patrons of the cathedral, however, preferring friars and monks to the secular church in their endowments and shunning a long tradition of Capetian support of Notre-Dame. Suffering from the resulting loss of prestige, the cathedral canons sought to appropriate the image of royal authority within their own ecclesiology and depicted the king in supplication to the Virgin Mary, whose image symbolized the church. In 1270 the kneeling praying figures we have come to identify as donor figures did not convey financial patronage of specific works of art, but rather spiritual supplication and entreaty. By showing the king and queen in a ritual gesture of supplication to Maria-Ecclesia, the portal expressed the church's ideal of the king subordinate and supplicant to the triumphant cathedral. Furthermore, in the image of the king the portal denies any likeness to the figure of Christ, rejecting the contemporary, but competing ideal articulated by the crown during Louis's reign of a sacral and christological kingship independent of the church. Rather than simply representing a reductive coronation iconography, the Porte Rouge offers a bold and deft statement of ecclesiastical authority and ideology of the second half of the thirteenth century."
24,Michel Dabas; Harry B. Titus; ,Non-Destructive Sensing Projects beneath Auxerre Cathedral,2001,"Teams of researchers from the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique led by Michel Dabas recently made electrostatic and radar surveys to locate structural elements lying beneath the paving in the nave of Auxerre Cathedral. While the radar survey made use of established technology, the electrostatic survey was conducted with prototype equipment developed by CNRS/Garchy personnel. Technically, the descriptive superiority of the electrostatic method was demonstrated, though the radar survey provided more accurate indications of the depth of sub-surface features. Computerized maps presenting the collected data in color-coded form are here interpreted by the authors and coordinated with documentary and physical evidence pertaining to the building history of Auxerre Cathedral. The primary goal of the project was to gather information about the eleventh-century cathedral that was gradually replaced in the Gothic period. The data, however, permitted the authors to develop hypotheses about pre-Romanesque structures and about the construction sequence of the extant Gothic building."
25,Anne M. Morganstern; ,Art and Ceremony in Papal Avignon: A Prescription for the Tomb of Clement VI,2001,"The reexamination of a protocol for the procession decorating the tomb of the Avignon pope, Clement VI, inserted in the final account of payments for the monument during the pope's lifetime, provides a new basis for visually reconstructing the monument. This enables some problems regarding the tomb's composition to be resolved, while providing new insights into the patron's participation in the creative process and the relation of the monument to the life of the curia. When compared with the coeval Ceremonial of Giacomo Gaetani Stefaneschi, and with other monuments from the period, the projected procession is seen to emphasize the pope's burial ceremony--and therefore his burial place--in the remote monastery church at La Chaise-Dieu (Auvergne), as well as the extensive family presence that has been stressed in the previous literature. Moreover, all the preserved tomb fragments can now be seen to correspond closely to the patron's directive. A comparison of the document with the sparse evidence of the escort to La Chaise-Dieu after the pope's death suggests that he planned his funeral at the same time that he planned the tomb. Examination of the tomb of the pope's nephew, Pierre de La Jugie, archbishop of Narbonne, supplements somewhat the image of the decoration that can be reconstructed from the protocol and surviving tomb fragments, and renews the question of the relation of the pope's tomb to secular monuments."
26,Peter Kidson; ,Bourges after Branner,2000,"This essay reconsiders the chronology of the construction of the cathedral of Bourges, delineating projects prior to the late twelfth-century date proposed by Branner. Two projects emerge, the first going back to the construction of the city wall in the 1170s, and the second from a decade later. In the scheme of rotated triangles the author suggests a critical linkage with Notre-Dame of Paris."

30,Eric Fernie; ,Robert Branner's Treatment of Architectural Sources and Precedents,2000,"This article begins by examining Robert Branner's use of metaphor on the one hand and the individual architect on the other in the explanation of the dissemination of styles. In the second part Branner's work is considered in a historiographical context and especially in relation to modernism. His ideal of the wholeness of conception within a building is symptomatic of modernist views of architecture, and his emphasis on the role of the individual architect parallels the modernist stress on the great artist and the avant-garde. This line of argument presupposes, somewhat problematically, the will of the individual architect, focused solely on stylistic problems and solutions, as a recall to order. It is contrasted with a more fluid model of the dissemination of style, which also considers the roles of function, ideology, economic circumstance, and local tradition. The author must, however, acknowledge that his critique relies on hindsight."

32,Virginie Nebelsztein; Bénédicte Fillion; ,Le Portail No. 25.120.878 du Musée des Cloîtres: une nouvelle attribution,2000,"The attribution of a portal in The Cloisters Museum (No. 25.120.878) to the church of the Poitevin priory of Saint-Jean de Bas-Nueil has never been fully convincing to experts. Moreover, the archival records concerning it present contradictions of a sort that prevent any firm conclusions. The question would have remained open but for the accidental find of the true Bas-Nueil portal in a private collection in 1995, in the course of research on the sculpture of the priory. At that point only a meticulous comparative stylistic analysis could identify the origin of portal No. 25.120.878. By a combination of documentary research and field work the abbey of Aiguevives was identified as a possible provenance. This conclusion was confirmed scientifically through neutron activation analysis, which showed that the composition of the stone of the portal in New York and at Aiguevives is the same."
33,Loretta Vandi; ,"""The Woman with the Flower."" Social and Artistic Identity in Medieval Italy",2000,"This contribution may be viewed as an investigation arising from the coalescence of art history and social history. Its main thrust is not only the identification of a woman artist by means of a self-portrait--the first of its kind from medieval Italy--but also the detection of a deeper-seated social attitude in the maker through the analysis of her pictorial style. In addition, we are able to watch her through the magnifying lens of medieval Bologna and the throbbing life attracted by its famous university. The ""woman with the flower,"" a very peculiar illuminated portrait appearing on fol. 162v in Malatestiano MS D.XXV.2 of the thirteenth century, preserved in Cesena, is identified as a self-portrait of the miniaturist of the entire manuscript by an argument which deals with the probable functions--explanatory, symbolic, and indicative--of the image. ""Donella,"" who is the historical figure tentatively recognized as the miniaturist, in this work of art and particularly in her self-portrait turns away from picturesque delectability and instead emphasizes the solidity of painted forms. The whole set of illuminations reveals an overwhelming artistic strength, and its substantial and original realism rejects uncompromisingly the artificiality of Byzantine classicism."
34,Nicolas Reveyron; ,Décors d'incrustation et tendances antiquisantes dans l'architecture romane de la moyenne vallée du Rhône,2000,"Inlaid decorations--inlays of mortar or putty in an incised stone support--resurrect an aesthetic and techniques belonging to the architecture of late antiquity. In the eleventh through the thirteenth centuries such decorations saw a notable revival in church architecture and liturgical furniture. The revival occurred in the east as well as in the west, beginning earlier in Greece and later in the western kingdoms. The geographic distribution of these decorations is spotty and fragmentary, however, just a few buildings in Greece, in the middle Rhône valley, in the north of France, and in England. At Vienne and Lyon, in the heart of Burgundy and part of the empire, the development of these inlaid decorations in Romanesque architecture of the second half of the twelfth and the beginning of the thirteenth centuries participated in a larger protorenaissance, as the Rhône valley surrounding these cities saw several clear examples of the renaissance of ancient forms both in architecture and in decoration. While the early Christian or Byzantine origin of these inlays may be elusive, the aesthetic of costliness which defines them permits a better understanding of the rôle played by this revival in the artistic politics of the archbishops. Before studying what the influences upon them might have been, it is advisable to clearly define the aesthetic represented by the three buildings involved: in Vienne the old collegiate church of Saint-André-le-Bas and the old cathedral of Saint-Maurice, and at Lyon the cathedral of Saint-Jean-Baptiste; in this way one can avoid historical contradictions in interpreting the comparisons. Furthermore, the chronological revisions suggested by recent research are the basis of a new understanding of the position of these two cities in late Romanesque art and of their relation to Burgundy, as a major monument of Romanesque art of the mid-twelfth century, the tomb of St.-Lazare, evidently played a significant role in the constitution of this revivalist aesthetic. The inlays of Autun belong to this movement. The inlays further demonstrate the large part played by Vienne, a part well established for sculpture."
